## Project Overview: FraudAlert

FraudAlert is an advanced AI-driven solution for detecting fraud in healthcare reimbursement claims, specifically targeting submissions to the CNAM (National Health Insurance Fund). This project leverages skills in machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics to improve operational efficiency and data security, with strategic and executive oversight guiding its development.

### Key Aspects of FraudAlert

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes YOLO for precise detection of relevant information on claim forms and Tesseract OCR to convert text images into structured data for analysis.

- **Verification Process**: Employs RegEx for validating data formats and NLP for content classification, with anomaly detection algorithms used to flag irregular entries indicative of potential fraud.

- **Database Matching**: Implements cross-checks using database matching algorithms against a centralized repository, ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of claims.

- **Impact**: FraudAlert reduces fraudulent claims, promotes transparency, and enhances resource allocation within healthcare, showcasing AIâ€™s transformative potential in fraud prevention.
